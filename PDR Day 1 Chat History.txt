I think thiose words partially match, volume captures the 3rd dimension they can utilize.  Can be a combo of PDR system enforced, board, slot or general volume %  for more boxes. Yes radiator & AVI tray represent the most obvious places to put items but I didn't want to limit their answer.

Evan and Joe, on the previous question -

 

We are holding 15% margin at PDR on heat load on avionics components, equivalent to 15% radiator area margin (with this method agreed to by NASA during SMC-S-016 adjudication). We also carry uncertainty on every heat load.

 

On volume margin, the space below the current layout of avi components is currently unutilized - this is available for harnessing and connector/ box reorientation in case the radiator area starts to get crowded

This is true and we are designing the topologies needed per interface that actually requires it. The next step is to see the minimum number of bespoke topologies we need to cover our bases. Leaning too hard into isolation will cause other bus performance issues where being too sporty will let flicker through

Joe, this is an area we can look at for detailed design. We have been modeling SOC drop during integrated traverses but not voltage bus drop. Anecdotally, our worst case EVA sortie SOC and resultant voltage was above the voltage required for those speeds. But it is a good action for more precise analysis.

For electrical box layout, on radiator what design criteria is adhered to for leaving room for wire connectors, harness bends and extra room needed to pull a connector out? (During layout on radiators, etc)
Avi boards and boxes in preliminary design have area reserved proportional to heat loads, which at PDR is intended to account for connector volume and access - detailed layout and clearances are forward work, with volume margin available below the tray.

 

Avi box layout, connector access volume, and integration on the FLIP rover Thermavant tray (currently underway) are informing our approach on this.

As another followup to this, we did reference the DC isolation guidelines defined per NASA-HDBK-4001. specifically figure 3 has a good illustration where DC isolated ground points ensure return currents are not parasitic, which is the same intent as single point ground

For FLIP the grounding scheme is somewhat different as we have single point ground through MPS (Modular Power System), we have a couple of devices on FLIP that Chassis GND and EE GND are shorted inside the box and we are evaluating the risk associated with these and evaluating potential mitigations (e.g. local isolation)

It's a bit distributed: the 01. Astrolab_PDR_Power_Energy_Analysis in the ISPA describes vehicle operational power states, including lighting. Crew accommodations and GNC PDR presentations describe the use of lights for their tasks. 

For our current energy analysis, we have primarily focused on the Traverse case, because it is the most stressing. So non-driving Crew Task Lighting is not fully represented in PEL analysis.

Gas vents into flanks following TR - we are looking at ensuring adjacent materials/ systems are not impacted by hot gases, through local insulation or by routing gases out of the flanks. Detailed analysis post-PDR.

How long is the configuration between motion stop and start of HGA use?
The flight software would start a track upon stop of vehicle motion.  FLEX maintains a good local pose using the star tracker and IMU and should be able to put a beam on target within a few seconds.  We have yet to characterize how long it takes to for the radios to resync, though, in particular for orbital assets.

sorry I missed this earlier. dust impacts to antennas is forward work but will be assessed in the development. in part this will be to determine to what extent we see dust buildup on various parts of the vehicle, but assuming there will be some dust coating we can look at the RF impacts of the dust. most antennas have radomes for some amount of dust protection, and the HGA will be assessed for coatings/coverings for dust ingress into the slot arrays

There is a many years long story behind that decision.  Odyssey has been working with cFS for over a decade, and that extensive experience gives them a great deal of knowledge about the strengths and weaknesses of cFS, especially in relation to the unique needs of human rated, safety-critical software.  Odyssey created Encore to provide a platform that was designed from the ground up for human rated, safety critical systems, and it was a relatively easy choice for us to use it for FLEX.

There will likely be a grey list that is coordinated between NASA and Astrolab, but like Dragon, we expect to rely on high level state transition commands rather than low level commands.  There will be some small number of lower level commands available for contingency scenarios, but it will be a clearly defined subset for contingency use only.

Have you considered crew audio in your prioritization discussion?
It's been part of our discussions, and we tend to default to prioritizing anything related to the crew and crew safety near the top of the list.  There has been a default understanding that crew communication with mission control is always high in priority during crewed missions.

We will never load any software on the vehicle that has not undergone testing and been proven to work on the HIL table on the ground and on our terrestrial prototype, and we will always only load known and validated versions.  All computers report their version information during bootup or initialization (depending on the computer).  Prior to launch we will test all software on the vehicle to ensure it functions in nominal and off-nominal test cases that can safely be run on the flight vehicle.  If or when we choose to upload a new version, we will first upload it into one of the redundant load slots and prove it works before ever moving that into the gold area - if we would ever do that.  It's unclear at this point if or when we would do that.

This has been a very hot topic amongst the team.  The consensus we are trending to is that the software will autonomously initiate deceleration but the crew has the ability to override the automated response.

The present navigation filter design intent is loosely-coupled integration. The PNT EKF is intended to present PNT measurements to the main EKF that are comparable to what a GPS receiver would provide. We'd like to try to keep the problem of needing to build a performant LunaNet GNSS receiver separate from developing a main navigation EKF that needs to function properly both with and without LunaNet augmentation.

Slide 21 refers to a slip state calculated. What is this to be used for?
The slip state is an input to FDIR. If the wheel slippage exceeds a safe limit, this triggers the vehicle to safe itself (uncrewed) or advises the crew to slow down (crewed)
