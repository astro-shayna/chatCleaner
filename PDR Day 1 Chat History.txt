To clarify the "TBD" in TPM-008 about manipulator tip force and moment, it's not that capability is not known, it's just that it can't be specified with one number in a chart.

Late questions on the prior slides.  I'm putting a go-back in chat so I don't forget about it.  

 

For the emergency ingress/egress, have you attempted any offloaded HITL testing (egress) and/or simulator testing (ingress) to categorize potential safety risks of skipping the step of commanding the desired chassis height?  For instance, for ingress, what are the risks of vehicle damage if the crew tries to start moving with the chassis low and raise up while in motion?  For egress, what are the risks of crew injury if the crew tries to egress at drive height?  I could see crew potentially being motivated to skip a task in an emergency and I wonder how severe the impact of doing so might or might not be.

 

For the EVA Prep Time, is any of this repeated at the end of the day, like dusting?

We dont have full details on what the keep out zones will be for telerobotic operation to drive LTV close to HLS, which will potentially be the main time factor for transferring the CDC from the HLS to FLEX.

I think the crew time metrics for those items - within HLS (i.e., pre-EVA retrieval) also have to be accounted for potentially - or at least scarred for. Even if the "transfer" is the dominant one related to distance.

true - we analyzed the distance for keep out zones based on the potential for dirt to be spewed and as long as we approach the HLS at less than 4 kph we can approach as close as 2 m. (for dirt ). there will undoubtedky be other constraints but it shouldbe very short.

assuming we are talking about retrieval from its HLS launch location, this along with transfer to LTV would fall under xEVAS operations, so we would not be able to provide an accurate estimate at this time.  for CDC checkout, I believe we can safely assume this to fall within the very first vehicle walkdown allocation of 5 min
